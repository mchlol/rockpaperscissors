# rockpaperscissors

This is my first attempt at building a game in JavaScript, built for The Odin Project. <br>
The game is only played in the console for now, a GUI will come later.<br>
<br>
This is practice for problem solving - breaking down a larger project into smaller chunks to work on, one at a time. It's also practice for working with JavaScript of course, and with using git and github.
<br>
You can play <a href="https://mchlol.github.io/rockpaperscissors/">here</a>. Open the console, and call game(); to get started.


<!-- 
Rock, paper, scissors

Computer chooses rock paper or scissors
  create an array containing the three choices in upper case
  use a method to randomly choose a number between 0-2
  use the number to access that index of the array
  create a function to make that the computers choice
Player chooses rock paper or scissors
  choice is converted to upper case for comparison to computer choice
  if choice is not rock paper or scissors show invalid choice
    prompt to choose again
Compare the two choices to determine winner of round
Keep score of number of rounds won by player and computer
  If either score is less than 5 play again
  If either has reached 5, game is over
